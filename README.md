# Indendent Study Research Project (updated Spring 2024)

## Abstract
This repository compiles my efforts in researching the effect of different type of attention mechanisms on the accuracy of Neural Machine Translation models. I attempt to keep the overall structure of these models as consistent as possible to avoid discrepencies during data extraction. I use their [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675) as the automated method of choice to evaluate the machine-generated translation scripts.  

## Background Information
