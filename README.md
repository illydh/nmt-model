# Spanish-to-English Translator (Neural Machine Translation)

## Credit to repositories

As a part of a research project, I originally cloned this repo by [@GargPriyanshu1112](https://github.com/GargPriyanshu1112/English-to-Spanish-Translator) who provided the basic framework of the bi-directional encoder-decoder using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)RNN and implemented the additive algorithm in the attention layer. 

The idea of expanding my research to the performance of this translation model with different attention mechanisms followed after studying this repo by [@monk1337](https://github.com/monk1337/Various-Attention-mechanisms) which delves into the implementation of various algorithms for computing the attention weights.

## Evaluation
I am evaluating the performance of each model using an imported BERTScore package, and by graphing their perplexity over epoch calculations.
